LabBook2:
1. ~/Attenuation/Calib/*800V.Spe
	#For actual calibration
2. Use these information to tell the energy resolution
#
Fill in FWHM.txt and Calib.txt
2.5Python plot of energy resolution
3. Make calibration equation, use that as the x-axis (energy) for my python plots
4. Draw conclusoin about how uncollimating leads to a build up factor.

1. Get the calibration equation for Wk1, Wk2, Wk4
2. Print the spectra in 12-07/Calibration/ShowEnergySelection-cutoff/*
	#Stick them into the lab book to show how the energy selection is done
	#hmm... may have to tweak the data a biiiiiiit.
3. Fit the resolution for a single detector.
4. Match a number of spectra to sources used in Wk1(11-16), to find efficiency
	#241Am
	#22Na
	#60Co
	#137Cs
	#Double check that the distance is exactly the same for all of them.
	#It should have been written on your lab book.
5. Run Deconv.C on /home/ocean/Documents/GitHubDir/DataAnalysis-NLab/CoincidenceTiming/12-07/TAC-Spectra/44Ti_Deconvolute_Coincidence_Decay_Period.Spe
