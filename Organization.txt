LabBook2:
1. ~/Attenuation/Calib/*800V.Spe
	#For actual calibration
2. Use these information to tell the energy resolution
#
Fill in FWHM.txt and Calib.txt
2.5Python plot of energy resolution
3. Make calibration equation, use that as the x-axis (energy) for my python plots
4. Draw conclusoin about how uncollimating leads to a build up factor.

LabBook3:
#In Wk4/:

Buffit Calibration/*.Spe

1. Get the calibration equation for Wk1, Wk2, Wk4
2. Print the spectra in 12-07/Calibration/ShowEnergySelection-cutoff/*
	#Stick them into the lab book to show how the energy selection is done
	#hmm... may have to tweak the data a biiiiiiit.
3. Fit the resolution for a single detector.
4. Match a number of spectra to sources used in Wk1(11-16), to find efficiency
	#241Am
	#22Na
	#60Co
	#137Cs
	#133Ba
	#
	#152Eu?
	#68Ge?
	#
	#NOT 44Ti
	#Double check that the distance is exactly the same for all of them.
	#It should have been written on your lab book.
5. Ask someone how to run Deconv.C on /home/ocean/Documents/GitHubDir/DataAnalysis-NLab/CoincidenceTiming/12-07/TAC-Spectra/44Ti_Deconvolute_Coincidence_Decay_Period.Spe

Write on lab book:
1. It is helpful to have a written table of known peak energies (with intensity >5%) of all the sources used, and a quick linear regression program.
	a. Find the centroid of peaks in simple spectra (Co-60 and Cs-137), put down their energies into a .txt file.
	b. Use the program to calculate a tenative best fit relationship between the gamma energy E_gamma and the channel number.
	c. Find the channel number we'd expect centroids of peaks to occur at in the next spectrum, using this tenative relationship.
		This step vastly reduces the chances of mis-matchin a peak to the wrong energy.
	d. Continuously update this .txt file so that the program can output an increasingly more accurate fit.
2. "The ShowEnergySelection-cutoff/* has to include part of each other peak's 'feet' because the detector's poor energy resolution. 
	This was done, as opposed to <insert graph explaining 'chopping off it's own feet to avoid the other peak'> because the former will boost the signal to noise ratio much more. The probability of a 78keV gamma being emitted within a 10 microsecond <or however many microseconds timeframe> after that is much higher than the probability of 67keV being emitted in the same time, so we decided to include more instead of less."
3. "In theory, the background spectrum should be subtracted from each spectrum to obtain the true count rate that is attributable to the source alone, before proceeding to the efficiency analysis. However, since the sources are much more intense at their selected energy range compared to the background radiation in that range, its error contribution is negligible, so this process of subtracting the background is ignored for most of the sources used (except 133Ba).
	Besides, the peak fitting program removes the counts attributable to Compton continuum of other gammas by simply fitting a 'background' (linearly varying with energy) in addition to the Gaussian signal (photopeak). Thus accounting for all background count rate not associated with the source as well in the process."
	(The assumption of a background count rate that varies linearly with energy is justified considering that the width of the peak is of the order of ~10 keV, so higher order terms in the energy variation in background are small, unless the peak of interest lies directly on top of a Compton edge.)
