LabBook2:
1. ~/Attenuation/Calib/*800V.Spe
	#For actual calibration
2. Use these information to tell the energy resolution
#
Fill in FWHM.txt and Calib.txt
2.5Python plot of energy resolution
3. Make calibration equation, use that as the x-axis (energy) for my python plots
4. Draw conclusoin about how uncollimating leads to a build up factor.

LabBook3:
Buffit OperatingVoltage_Gain/*
#In 11-16/: 
Buffit 133* 44* Background.Spe BrazilNuts.Spe 241*
	#133 should only be a scaled up version of its counterpart.
#In 11-23/:
Buffit TimeCoin_1microsRange_halfmicrosDelay.Spe, */152Eu, */137Cs, */60Co
	#
#In 11-30/:
Buffit *
#In 12-07/:
Buffit TAC-Spectra/*
SetFixedFWHM()
Buffit Calibration* Calibration*/*

2. Extract the duration and date info for ~/Coincidence/Calib/11-16/* and ~/Coincidence/Calib/11-30
	#Make a readme file in each of the said directory
	#each of the timing/efficiency related plot.
Get the calibration equation for each week
5. Match a number of spectra to sources used in Aut7(11-16), and fit those ones
	#241Am
	#22Na
	#60Co
	#137Cs
6. Use the same data for resolution
7. Fit all Gaussian peaks (timing coins for 22Na) to get their thingy
8. Run Deconv.C on ~/Coincidence/Calib/12-07/44Ti_Deconvolute_Coincidence_Decay_Period.Spe
9. Fit a few of those cut-off (into parabolic on the log-scale) just to print it on the lab book
	#Find the time as well so that you can use the calibration equation
