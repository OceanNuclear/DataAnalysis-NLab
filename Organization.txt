LabBook2:
1. ~/Attenuation/Calib/*800V.Spe
	#For actual calibration
2. Use these information to tell the energy resolution
#
Fill in FWHM.txt and Calib.txt
2.5Python plot of energy resolution
3. Make calibration equation, use that as the x-axis (energy) for my python plots
4. Draw conclusoin about how uncollimating leads to a build up factor.

LabBook3:
#In Wk2/Calibration:
Buffit 152Eu*

#In Wk4/:
SetFixedFWHM()
Buffit Calibration/*.Spe

1. Get the calibration equation for Wk1, Wk2, Wk4
2. Print the spectra in 12-07/Calibration/ShowEnergySelection-cutoff/*
	#Stick them into the lab book to show how the energy selection is done
	#hmm... may have to tweak the data a biiiiiiit.
3. Fit the resolution for a single detector.
4. Match a number of spectra to sources used in Wk1(11-16), to find efficiency
	#241Am
	#22Na
	#60Co
	#137Cs
	#133Ba
	#
	#152Eu?
	#68Ge?
	#
	#NOT 44Ti
	#Double check that the distance is exactly the same for all of them.
	#It should have been written on your lab book.
5. Ask someone how to run Deconv.C on /home/ocean/Documents/GitHubDir/DataAnalysis-NLab/CoincidenceTiming/12-07/TAC-Spectra/44Ti_Deconvolute_Coincidence_Decay_Period.Spe

Write on lab book:
1. It is helpful to have a written table of known peak energies (with intensity >5%) of all the sources used, and a quick linear regression program.
	a. Find the centroid of peaks in simple spectra (Co-60 and Cs-137), put down their energies into a .txt file.
	b. Use the program to calculate a tenative best fit relationship between the gamma energy E_gamma and the channel number.
	c. Find the channel number we'd expect centroids of peaks to occur at in the next spectrum, using this tenative relationship.
		This step vastly reduces the chances of mis-matchin a peak to the wrong energy.
	d. Continuously update this .txt file so that the program can output an increasingly more accurate fit.
